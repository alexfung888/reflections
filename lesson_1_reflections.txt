How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Get rid of the lines that are identical and can be ignored.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It is easier to track down changes that may have caused the problem, or to fall back to a knwon workable version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros: can exercise judgement to commit at logical point, easier to reference.
Cons: may forget to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git is designed for source files, which is often a group of files related to each other
Google Docs is designed for documents with automated commitment.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all the commits. git diff on two adject commits shows the change made in that commit


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

I am more confident because it is possible to backtrack to identify and revert the code that breaks something.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
